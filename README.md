##Power of Sensible Defaults

The choice for the Sensible Default is one that should be carefully considered, both in relation to the technical problems it will need to solve and the skills in the organisation. A Sensible Default choice has wider ranging impacts that just the local team, so the candidates for the default need to be assessed against different scenarios aside and with the wider team. I’m not going to go into the process of making technology choices, as this topic probably deserves it’s own blog post, but I do want to comment on how decisions should be documented.

You can read further about why it is a good idea to document sensible defaults here.
